Project 1 - Arch Linux
Pre-Installation
Type cat /sys/firmware/efi/fw_platform_size
You should get 64, I originally struggled and got a null return, I figured it out by changing settings while creating the VM
Type fdisk -l (Should return /dev/sda)
Use fdisk and the disk found using the above and type fdisk /dev/sda
Go through fdisk and create 2 partitions
Format the partitions. One should be fat32 and the other should be ext4
Type mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sda1 and mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2
Now mount the system with mount
Type mount /dev/sda2 /mnt and mkdir /mnt/boot /mnt/var /mnt/home and mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot





Installation and Configuration
Install packages by typing pacstrap -K /mnt base linux linux-firmware
Now type genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
Check this file by typing nano /mnt/etc/fstab
Type arch-chroot /mnt to change root into the new system to configure and localize it
I did the Time and Localization in reverse order as I found it easier.
Type ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Chicago /etc/localtime but replace America/Chicago with your region and city
Type hwclock –systohc –utc (I added the –utc to ensure it was set correctly)
 nano /etc/locale.gen and find en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 or your corresponding locale
Type echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf
Type export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
Set the hostname to archlinux by typing echo archlinux > /etc/hostname
Type systemctl enable dhcpcd to complete network configuration
Type mkinitcpio -P
Now set the root password and create users
Type passwd root and set the root password
Now type useradd -m -g users -G wheel -s /bin/bash phil
Repeat the above step but replace phil with justin and codi
Type passwd phil and set the password
Repeat the above and set the password to GraceHopper1906
Type nano /etc/sudoers and add phil ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL and repeat for the above names to give them sudo
Type exit to leave the system configuration
Type umount /mnt/boot and umount/mnt
Type reboot
When you reenter, type sudo pacman -Syy
Type sudo pacman -S openssh to install ssh
Type sudo pacman -S zsh to install a new shell
Type sudo pacman -S --needed lxqt xdg-utils ttf-freefont sddm xorg firefox vlc filezilla leafpad xscreensaver archlinux-wallpaper to install LXQT and all the needed components
Restart because you get an error that you are out of space
After several rounds of this attempt to clear space on your laptop as you believe that is the issue
It is not the issue
Enjoy the Arch Linux experience
